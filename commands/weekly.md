# /weekly — Last Week Summary

**Role:** Surface what moved last Mon–Fri across all clients (or one client). Three output layers: signal list, product translation, pushback prep. Book-backed narrative.

**Vault:** `$QH_KNOWLEDGE/`

---

## Trigger
`/weekly [CLIENT?]`

- No argument: all clients, grouped by client
- With client name (e.g. `/weekly [CLIENT]`): filtered to that client only
- Time window: always last Mon–Fri calculated from today. If today is Monday, use the prior week — not the week that just started.

---

## Step 0 — Announce the plan

State:
- Which clients will be covered (or which client if filtered)
- The calculated time window (Mon DD – Fri DD)
- What sources will be read
- What the output will contain

Wait for confirmation before reading.

---

## Step 1 — Calculate time window

Run `date` to confirm today's date.
Calculate last Mon–Fri from today's actual date — do not rely on session context.
State the window explicitly before proceeding: "Window: Mon May 12 – Fri May 16."

---

## Step 2 — Read all signals

**Jira** — tickets with activity in the window:
- Status transitions (moved to In Progress, Done, Blocked)
- Comments or updates posted in the window
- Drop: tickets with no activity in the window

**Vault** — `02-tickets/*/` state files and session logs:
- Session log files dated within the window
- KNOWN blocks that reference activity in the window
- Richer "what actually happened" detail that Jira does not capture

**Slack** — client channels, last 7 days:
- Unresolved threads containing a question, concern, or decision
- Drop: acknowledgment-only threads, resolved chatter

**Calendar** — meetings in the window:
- Client calls that occurred — note if outcomes were captured in vault
- Drop: events with no work outcome

---

## Step 3 — Synthesize: signal vs noise

Filter the raw reading into a signal list:

- **Changed:** tickets closed, decisions made, blockers resolved, fixes deployed
- **Stuck:** tickets with no movement where movement was expected
- **Coming:** immediate next actions required this week

State what was dropped and why in one line before presenting the signal list. If nothing was dropped, say so. This transparency lets Dipen correct the filter before the narrative layers are built.

---

## Step 4 — Explain-back gate

Present the signal list only. Do not produce translation or pushback layers yet.

> "Does this signal list match what you remember from last week? Anything missing or incorrectly included?"

Wait for confirmation or correction before continuing to Step 5.

---

Apply these principles to build the translation and pushback layers:
- Minto: conclusion first — the outcome leads, not the mechanism
- Heath (Made to Stick): concrete specifics, never "some records had issues" — always "4 of 7 sub-tickets closed, 3 remain"
- Voss: label the concern before they raise it — surface their likely question first, then answer it
- Carnegie: frame in terms of what matters to them, not what happened to the system

---

## Step 6 — Produce output

Group by client. For each client:

```
── [CLIENT] ─────────────────────────────────────────

Signal
  [TICKET-ID]  [ticket name]          [STATUS] — [one-line context]

Say it as
  [TICKET-ID]  [one sentence — outcome for the client, no jargon, no mechanism]

Prepare for
  "[Likely question from product or non-technical stakeholder]"
    [Answer in client voice. Conclusion first. Concrete. No internal tooling names.]
```

Rules:
- Signal: only items that changed in the window. No unchanged backlog items.
- Say it as: what this means for the client's data or delivery — not what happened in the pipeline.
- Prepare for: one to three questions per client, surfaced before they are raised. If no sticky area exists for a client, omit the section.
- If a client had zero movement in the window, say "No movement last week" explicitly — do not skip the client silently.

---

## Step 7 — After review

> "After the call, run `/capture` to document outcomes, decisions, and action items from the discussion."
